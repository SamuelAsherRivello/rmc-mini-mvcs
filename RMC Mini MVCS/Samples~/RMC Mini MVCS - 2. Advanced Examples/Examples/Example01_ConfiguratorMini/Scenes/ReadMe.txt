This is a multi-scene demo. You must add all Scenes in this folder to the Unity build settings before pressing play. Enjoy!

This Demonstrates
* Multi-scene - So the Mini persists across scene changes
* Mini Mvcs "Feature" - Structure to easily turn on and off groups of related concerns
* Local Disk Storage - So values persist between play sessions
