# Tutorial Framework
---------
This package is needed to have In-Editor Tutorials working.

IMPORTANT: before updating to this version, please update to the closest major version to the one you're currently using. This ensures that existing tutorials are properly converted and updated without any data loss.

## Setup
For Unity 2021.2 and newer, simply search for "Tutorial Framework" in the Package Manager. For older Unity versions, this package is not currently discoverable,
and you need to add the following line to the `dependencies` list of `Packages/manifest.json`:  
`"com.unity.learn.iet-framework": "3.1.1" `

Make sure to update to the latest version of the package.

## Authoring tools
For instructions on how to add authoring tools, see the [Tutorial Authoring Tools documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.learn.iet-framework.authoring@latest).
